## Research results

We’re taking an Agile approach by implementing scrum plus some values and practices from the XP framework. There are 3 topics below (values, roles and practices) where we explain what we’re using for our chosen Agile approach.

Values
Within scrum there are the following values:
Commitment: Each team member commits to achieving the team goals.
Focus: The team’s focus should be on the work of a sprint to progress the fastest possible way towards achieving their goals.
Openness: The team and stakeholders are open to deal with all the work and the challenges. 
Respect: The team member’s must have respect for each other to be capable and independent.
Courage: The team members must have the courage to do the right thing and work on difficult problems.
Next to scrum’s values there’s also some values in XP, they are mostly the same only really adding 2 extra which are:
Feedback: As a team asking for constant feedback from the stakeholders is very important, so that the team can improve on their previous efforts.
Simplicity: The most important thing to keep in mind in software is to keep things simple. It’s important to work on only those requirements that are actually needed, so don’t try to predict things.

Roles
Then onto the roles within the scrum team:
Product Owner: This role is supposed to manage the product backlog which in our case would more or less tell us what stories need to change and what stories are good.
Developers: The development team will work each sprint to deliver the increment to gain value and decide how the work should be divided between the team members.
Scrum Master: The scrum master has to ensure that the team follows the values and practices that the team agreed on using.

Practices
Scrum events
Sprints: Sprints are a way to mitigate uncertainty by using an iterative approach. A sprint is a fixed length usually 2, 3 or 4 weeks. In our case we have 5 sprints each being 3 weeks long. During each sprint we’ll be working on the sprint planning, daily standups, the sprint review and the retrospective.
Sprint Planning (meeting): The first thing that the team does each sprint is selecting which stories should be done that sprint. The meeting consists of 3 topics, the first one is defining the sprint goal. This is done by letting the product owner propose an idea of how to improve the product further. Then the scrum team will decide on what this goal should be before the end of the meeting. The next one is picking what stories from the backlog are supposed to be completed. These stories may need some refinement to increase understanding. Figuring out how much should be done depends on the story points and the previous performance of the team. The last topic is to create smaller tasks from the stories (increments) which can be done in a day or less. This is done by only the developers. These smaller tasks or increments need to meet the definition of done.
Daily Standup: The team starts off everyday in a meeting for about 15 minutes telling each other the work they did the day before, what they're going to be working on next and if they’ve encountered any problems. With this meeting the team makes sure to adjust quickly when encountering any problems.
Sprint Review: The second to last thing the team is supposed to do each sprint is reviewing the work that has been done. The team presents their results to the stakeholders and also talks about what they are going to work on next. This way the stakeholders can give the team feedback. The team can then negotiate about what to maybe change about the backlog. When reviewing the sprint the stakeholders want to see the functionality and not necessarily a presentation. 
Retrospective: The last event within a sprint is the retrospective. This is where the team discusses what went well, and what can be improved on. The team looks at an individual level, at the interactions, the processes, tools and the definition of done. The team also thinks about possible solutions and might even update the backlog if needed.

Scrum artifacts, per artifact there’s a separate commitment to measure progress. 
Product Backlog: The product backlog contains a list of stories that are ordered from most important to least important. These stories should be mostly ready in the product backlog to add them later at every sprint planning meeting. The commitment of the product backlog is called the product goal. This ultimately is what the end product is supposed to be according to the stakeholders.
Sprint Backlog: This is strictly for the developers. The sprint backlog contains the stories and smaller tasks or increments to reach the sprint goal. The sprint goal is a single goal that the team works towards each sprint. The sprint backlog should be detailed enough so that there’s always progress to look at and talk about at the daily standup.
Increment: An increment is a step towards the product goal. Each increment must follow the definition of done before its presented at the sprint review.
Sprint Burndown: The sprint burndown is an estimation based on the total completed story points at any given time in the sprint. This can be visualized with a burndown chart which tells the team if they’re on the right track. At the daily standups the team must check what the progress is on the burndown chart.

As to why we went for an Agile approach using scrum instead of e.g. the waterfall approach is that the waterfall approach is considered a “linear” way of working, which means that you normally start with your analysis until it’s “finished”, after that you work on the design and so on. This would cause problems because things can always be improved upon so how do you know when you're done so that you mitigate risking wasted time and keep things predictable? That’s why we chose this Agile approach, because instead of being linear it’s an iterative approach. You have multiple sprint’s which consist of a cycle that contains all the major aspects of development (analysis, design, implementation and testing). This way you keep improving the process without sacrificing a lot of valuable time.
